Small thanks to:
flintandsteel by Minni6in - https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/1792
Better Flint and Steel - https://mods.vintagestory.at/flintandsteeladdon

I don't think i ended up using any of their code, but as this was my first mod, i learned a bit from looking at theirs.



Version Log

- Fixed bug where hunger would go negative.
- Added 'merge' ability to matches - dragging one on top the other will merge durability.
- Added `ignitionSound`s, chose best vanilla sounds for item
- Confirmed working on game version 1.20.1
- Survival good trader sells bow drill and flint and steel (expensive!)
- Tool Vessel can drop crude or regular bow drill
- Default Firestarter can now be stored on a tool rack, and doesn't need a wall
- All Firestarters can now be stored on a tool rack, and some on a shelf.
